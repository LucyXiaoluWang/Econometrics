   This lesson will focus on instrumental variables and how to perform IV in R.
   
   It will require the use of the packages **scales**, **tidyverse**, **jtools**, **estimatr**, and **AER**.
   
   If you do not have those installed, you can exit out of here (bye() works), install them with
   
   install.packages(c('scales','tidyverse','jtools','estimatr','AER'), dependencies = TRUE)
   
   and return here with swirl()

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Now we will load all of the libraries we need. You can copy the code below to do so, or just type skip() and it will do it for you.
   
   library(tidyverse)
  CorrectAnswer: library(tidyverse)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='library(tidyverse)')
  Hint: Put in library(tidyverse)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Now library(jtools)
  CorrectAnswer: library(jtools)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='library(jtools)')
  Hint: Put in library(jtools)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Now library(estimatr)
  CorrectAnswer: library(estimatr)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='library(estimatr)')
  Hint: Put in library(estimatr)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Now library(AER)
  CorrectAnswer: library(AER)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='library(AER)')
  Hint: Put in library(AER)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Now library(scales)
  CorrectAnswer: library(scales)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='library(scales)')
  Hint: Put in library(scales)

   Next we will load our data.
   
   We will be using the data set CigarettesSW from the AER package.
   
   This data set allows us to look at whether raising the price of cigarettes reduces smoking (and by how much).
   
   Use data() to load CigarettesSW
  CorrectAnswer: data(CigarettesSW) 
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('data(CigarettesSW)','data(CigarettesSW, package = "AER")','data("CigarettesSW")', 'data("CigarettesSW",package="AER")')
  Hint: Since we've already loaded AER, we can just use data(CigarettesSW)


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Click on CigarettesSW to look at it.
  CorrectAnswer: View(CigarettesSW)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='View(CigarettesSW)')
  Hint: Click on CigarettesSW in the Environment tab.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   The data set has data on each state in both 1985 and 1995. To simplify things, let's look only at 1995.
   
   Use filter to keep only the observations for which year is 1995. Overwrite the original CigarettesSW with this.
  CorrectAnswer: CigarettesSW <- CigarettesSW %>% filter(year == 1995)
  AnswerTests: nrow(CigarettesSW) == 48 & sum(CigarettesSW$year == 1995) == 48; expr_creates_var('CigarettesSW'); expr_uses_func('filter')
  Hint: Use Pass CigarettesSW to filter() where you will specify that year must be == to 1995. If you already overwrote CigarettesSW with something wrong, you might need to reload it with data(CigarettesSW) before doing this step.


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |- 
   We are interested in the effect of cigarette prices on the number of cigarette packs purchased.
   
   First, we need to adjust prices for inflation.
   
   Use mutate to create a new variable in CigarettesSW called rprice that's equal to price/cpi.
  CorrectAnswer: CigarettesSW <- CigarettesSW %>% mutate(rprice = price/cpi)
  AnswerTests: cor(CigarettesSW[['rprice']], CigarettesSW[['price']]/CigarettesSW['cpi']) > .99; expr_uses_func('mutate')
  Hint: You know how to mutate a new variable! data %>% mutate(newvar = oldstuff)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Now let's get a raw association between packs and prices
   
   Regress the logarithm (log()) of packs on the logarithm of inflation-adjusted prices and store the result as ols.
  CorrectAnswer: ols <- lm(log(packs) ~ log(rprice), data = CigarettesSW)
  AnswerTests: ifelse(exists('ols'), cor(predict(ols), predict(lm(log(packs) ~ log(rprice), data = CigarettesSW))) > .99, FALSE)
  Hint: Just run a regression as normal of log(packs) on log(rprice).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Look at the result using export_summs()
  CorrectAnswer: export_summs(ols)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('export_summs(ols)','ols %>% export_summs()')
  Hint: Send ols to export_summs()

- Class: mult_question
  Output: How can we interpret the -1.21 coefficient?
  AnswerChoices: A 1% increase in rprice is associated with a 1.21% decrease in packs; A 1% increase in rprice causes packs sold to drop by 1.21%; A one-unit increase in rprice reduces packs sold by 1.21 on average; A one-unit increase in rprice is associated with a 1.21-unit drop in packs
  CorrectAnswer: A 1% increase in rprice is associated with a 1.21% decrease in packs
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='A 1% increase in rprice is associated with a 1.21% decrease in packs')
  Hint: Don't forget the variables are both logged! Also, there might be some endogeneity problems here.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Why might we be skeptical of thinking the result in ols represents a causal effect?
  AnswerChoices: Because the price of cigarettes is responsive to how many packs people want to buy; Unexpected shocks to price are in the error term; Prices are in effect randomly assigned
  CorrectAnswer: Because the price of cigarettes is responsive to how many packs people want to buy
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Because the price of cigarettes is responsive to how many packs people want to buy')
  Hint: Endogeneity arises from things that might affect both treatment and outcome

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   To identify the effect of log(rprice) on log(packs), we will be using taxes as an instrument.
   
   The idea is that sales taxes on cigarettes should change the price of cigarettes, but not in a way that is driven by the demand for packs itself.
   
   The data contains a "sales and excise taxes" variable taxs, and an "excise taxes" variable tax.
   
   Use mutate to create a new variable called taxdiff, equal to (taxs-tax)/cpi.
  CorrectAnswer: CigarettesSW <- CigarettesSW %>% mutate(taxdiff = (taxs-tax)/cpi)
  AnswerTests: cor(CigarettesSW[['taxdiff']], (CigarettesSW[['taxs']]-CigarettesSW[['tax']])/CigarettesSW[['cpi']]) > .99; expr_uses_func('mutate')
  Hint: Mutate a new variables taxdiff = (taxs - tax)/cpi and overwrite the original CigarettesSW


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   We will be using the estimatr command iv_robust to estimate our IV models.
   
   Use help(iv_robust) to look at how to use iv_robust. Pay particular attention to how the IV formula is set up (perhaps look at those examples at the bottom), where we use | to separate the second stage from the first stage.
   
   outcome ~ endogenous_variable + control | instrument + control
  CorrectAnswer: help(iv_robust)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='help(iv_robust)')
  Hint: Just type help(iv_robust)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Use iv_robust to regress log(packs) on log(rprice), using taxdiff as an instrument. No controls included.
   
   Save the result as iv1.
  CorrectAnswer: iv1 <- iv_robust(log(packs) ~ log(rprice) | taxdiff, data = CigarettesSW)
  AnswerTests: ifelse(exists('iv1'),cor(iv1$fitted.values, iv_robust(log(packs) ~ log(rprice) | taxdiff, data = CigarettesSW)$fitted.values) > .99, FALSE)
  Hint: Use iv_robust just like you use lm or lm_robust, but with | taxdiff added on to the end of the formula.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use export_summs() to look at ols and iv1 together.
  CorrectAnswer: export_summs(ols, iv1)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='export_summs(ols, iv1)')
  Hint: Send both ols and iv1, in that order, to export_summs()

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Assuming that our instrument is relevant and valid, how can we best interpret the -1.08 coefficient?
  AnswerChoices: A 1% increase in rprice driven by tax increases will decrease packs sold by 1.08%; On average, a 1% increase in rprice will decrease packs sold by 1.08%
  CorrectAnswer: A 1% increase in rprice driven by tax increases will decrease packs sold by 1.08%
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='A 1% increase in rprice driven by tax increases will decrease packs sold by 1.08%')
  Hint: IV isolates only the part of the treatment variation that is driven by the instrument

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Even if we assume the instrument is relevant and valid, why might we still be concerned that this estimate is biased?
  AnswerChoices: IV is biased in small samples, and this sample is very small; The appropriate model is probably not linear; The instrument may be correlated with some omitted variable; The endogenous variable may be correlated with some omitted variable
  CorrectAnswer: IV is biased in small samples, and this sample is very small
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='IV is biased in small samples, and this sample is very small')
  Hint: Even if an instrument is valid in the population, in a given sample there might be an incidental correlation, driving bias.


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Run the "first stage" model using lm_robust(), showing the impact of the instrument on the endogenous variable. Send it straight to summary() rather than saving it or sending it to export_summs().
  CorrectAnswer: CigarettesSW %>% lm_robust(log(rprice) ~ taxdiff, data = .) %>% summary()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='CigarettesSW %>% lm_robust(log(rprice) ~ taxdiff, data = .) %>% summary()')
  Hint: Use lm_robust to regress log(rprice) on taxdiff, and send the result to summary()

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Does this result raise any clear concerns about taxdiff being a weak instrument?
  AnswerChoices: No; Yes; This provides no information about being a weak instrument
  CorrectAnswer: No
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='No')
  Hint: A common rule of thumb is that a t-statistic on the instrument of less than 3 raises weak instrument concerns (although using a rule of thumb in general for this is not ideal).

- Class: mult_question
  Output: |-
   So far we've just assumed that the instrument is exogenous.
   
   How much thought and modeling and consideration should we have put into determining whether we actually think the instrument is exogenous/valid?
  AnswerChoices: A lot; A whole lot; Just a heck of a lot; Way more than we did; An astounding amount
  CorrectAnswer: Just a heck of a lot
  AnswerTests: TRUE
  Hint: Yes.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Let's introduce a second instrument and see what that gets us.
   
   We'll be using the amount of overall excise taxes, the variable tax, as another instrument.
   
   Rerun your iv_robust model but also include tax as an instrument. Also set diagnostics = TRUE. Save the result as iv2.
  CorrectAnswer: iv2 <- iv_robust(log(packs) ~ log(rprice) | taxdiff + tax, data = CigarettesSW, diagnostics = TRUE)
  AnswerTests: ifelse(exists('iv2'),cor(iv2$fitted.values, iv_robust(log(packs) ~ log(rprice) | taxdiff + tax, data = CigarettesSW, diagnostics = TRUE)$fitted.values) > .99, FALSE); !is.null(iv2[['diagnostic_first_stage_fstatistic']])
  Hint: Reuse your iv1 code, but add +tax after taxdiff and set diagnostics = TRUE.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Type iv2$ and let autocomplete help you find the first-stage F statistic stored in iv2 because you set diagnostics = TRUE.
  CorrectAnswer: iv2$diagnostic_first_stage_fstatistic
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='iv2$diagnostic_first_stage_fstatistic')
  Hint: If you type iv2$ and start using the arrow keys, eventually you'll find an option that looks like "diagnostic f statistic". Hit enter on that! Then run the result.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   That's a little difficult to parse with all the e notation.
   
   Print the iv2$diagnostic_first_stage_fstatistic again, but this time wrap it in number(accuracy = .1) from the scales package. This will make it a bit easier to read.
  CorrectAnswer: number(iv2$diagnostic_first_stage_fstatistic, accuracy = .1)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('number(iv2$diagnostic_first_stage_fstatistic, accuracy = .1)', 'iv2$diagnostic_first_stage_fstatistic %>% number(accuracy = .1)')
  Hint: Just take the same answer from last time and make it the first argument of number() with the accuracy = .1 option set.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Does this result raise any clear concerns about weak instrument problems?
  AnswerChoices: No; Yes; This provides no information about being a weak instrument
  CorrectAnswer: No
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='No')
  Hint: A common rule of thumb is that a first-stage F-statistic (which is what this diagnostic F-statistic is) of less than 10  raises weak instrument concerns (although using a rule of thumb in general for this is not ideal).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Type iv2$ and let autocomplete help you find the overidentification test statistic stored in iv2 because you set diagnostics = TRUE.
  CorrectAnswer: iv2$diagnostic_overid_test
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='iv2$diagnostic_overid_test')
  Hint: If you type iv2$ and start using the arrow keys, eventually you'll find an option that looks like "diagnostic overid test". Hit enter on that! Then run the result.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: |-
   An overidentification test is a test you can use when you have more IVs than you need. You test whether the second-stage effect you get would be different depending on which IV you use.
   
   If they're different, we can take that as some evidence that at least one of the instruments is endogenous.
   
   Does this test show that the two estimates are different?
  AnswerChoices: No; Yes; No way to tell
  CorrectAnswer: No
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='No')
  Hint: The "value" shows the size of the difference, and the p.value shows the p-value from a test that they're different, with a null that they are the same.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: |-
   What is the best interpretation to take from the null result in the overidentification test?
  AnswerChoices: If one of the instruments is valid, they both are; The second instrument is redundant; Both instruments are valid; Neither instrument is valid; The addition of the second instrument helps ease weak instrument problems.
  CorrectAnswer: If one of the instruments is valid, they both are
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='If one of the instruments is valid, they both are')
  Hint: The test simply checks whether each instrument gives the same results. If we're pretty sure that at least one of them is valid, then the other one giving similar results is a good sign.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Finally, use plot_coefs() to plot ols, iv1, and iv2. 
   
   Take note not just of how the coefficient changes, but also the confidence intervals do. IV is a lot less precise! Although predicting the endogenous variable better (as we do with the addition of the second instrument) helps a lot.
  CorrectAnswer: plot_coefs(ols,iv1,iv2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plot_coefs(ols,iv1,iv2)')
  Hint: Send ols, iv1, and iv2 to plot_coefs().
